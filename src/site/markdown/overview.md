# Markdown
Markdown is a very nice formatting language.  It's simple, easy to use, and looks a lot like the standard formatting people usually use for plaintext, like *single asterix for italics* and **double asterix for bold**.

For more information, you can check out the Wikipedia entry on [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Markdown).

## Maven
Here's the link to the [Maven Doxia plugin for Markdown](http://maven.apache.org/doxia/doxia/doxia-modules/doxia-module-markdown/index.html).  The [Doxia overview page shows using Markdown](http://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/index.html) by default.

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of documentation there - but at least you have this project showing you a simple example!

These Markdwon files will automatically be turned into .html files with the matching name.  For example, this overview.md file gets turned into overview.html.

Here's an example of linking to a [second markdown page](second.html).  Not too tricky. 

## Editors 
What's nice about this is that you can use one of a very large number of Markdown editors for writing your Maven documentation.  Just search for Markdown editor and your platform on Google and you should find several nice ones.

FWIW, I've been using recently [Valletta](https://itunes.apple.com/app/valletta-markdown-editor/id504794951) on Mac OS X lately.
